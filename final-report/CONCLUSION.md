# Code Optimization for STM32F103/STM32F407 Discovery Boards – Time and Memory Analysis

## Conclusion

### Summary of Key Findings

This study has demonstrated that strategic optimization techniques can significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of embedded systems operating under resource constraints. By focusing on the STM32F103 and STM32F407 Discovery Boards and evaluating the Bubble Sort, ASCON, and GOST 28147-89 algorithms, we have shown that tailored combinations of optimizations—such as compiler flag adjustments, code size reduction, and performance-oriented programming—are essential for achieving optimal outcomes.

### Practical Recommendations

These findings have significant implications for developers working on embedded systems, particularly in IoT applications where resource limitations are prevalent. By adopting a multifaceted optimization approach and understanding the trade-offs between memory usage and execution speed, developers can design more efficient and capable systems. Future research should aim to generalize these optimization strategies across diverse algorithms and hardware platforms, while also exploring additional dimensions such as power efficiency and security. Through continued refinement of optimization techniques, we can further advance the capabilities of embedded systems in an increasingly connected and resource-constrained world.
