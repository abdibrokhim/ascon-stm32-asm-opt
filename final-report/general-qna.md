# General Questions

i just wanted to share some general questions that might arise while you are writing your thesis project.

## should i write my thesis in active voice or passive voice?

Here are sources that discuss whether you should write your thesis in active or passive voice:

1. **Paperpal** explains that both active and passive voice have their place in research writing. The choice depends on clarity and emphasis: use active voice for objectivity and passive when the performer is unimportant or the process is more important (often in the methods section). A combination of both is recommended for clarity and cadence[1].

2. **GradeCrest** states that active voice is generally preferred in academic writing for its strength, conciseness, and clarity. It is especially recommended in the introduction, discussion, and literature review sections. Passive voice is sometimes used in scientific writing, particularly when the agent is unknown or unimportant, or in the methods section[2].

3. **University of Puerto Rico, RÃ­o Piedras (PDF)** highlights the benefits of active voice: clarity, conciseness, engagement, and directness. Passive voice can make writing confusing and weaken arguments, so active voice is usually better for undergraduates aiming for strong, clear arguments[3].

4. **PapersOwl** notes that passive voice shifts focus to the action rather than the actor, which can be useful for objectivity and in summarizing results or describing methods. However, overuse can make writing less engaging and harder to follow[4].

5. **Editage** discusses the trend toward using more active voice in research writing for readability and clarity. Active voice is preferred in introductions and discussions, while passive voice is still common in methods sections. The guiding principle should always be clarity for the reader[5].

6. **Editage (second article)** further explains that the choice between active and passive voice depends on what you want to emphasize and is sometimes a matter of style. Active voice is generally preferred, but passive voice is appropriate in certain contexts, especially in methodological descriptions[6].

These sources collectively recommend using active voice for most of your thesis, especially in sections where clarity, engagement, and argument strength are important, but acknowledge that passive voice is appropriate in some contexts, such as describing methods or when the actor is unimportant. A balanced approach is widely endorsed.
