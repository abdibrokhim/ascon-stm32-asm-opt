today i spent my whole day for ascon. so... few results from todays experiments: 

original: [4]: bi32_armv7m_small: 32-bit small bit-interleaved ARMv7-M, ARMv8, ARMv9. time; took 10:57 seconds. (c and inline asm implementation)

exp 1: time: 10:44 seconds. (1.98% faster than [4])

exp 2: time: 09:56 seconds. (9.28% faster than [4])

notes: i just manipulated with inline asm code. thats it.
