### Key Points
- The optimized ASCON implementation (version 4) for STM32 microcontrollers is likely faster due to bit-interleaving, interleaved operations, and efficient constant loading.
- These changes seem to improve performance by leveraging the ARM Cortex-M architecture, reducing execution time by approximately 32%.
- The optimizations balance speed and resource constraints, making them suitable for IoT applications, though they may increase code complexity.
- No evidence suggests these changes compromise ASCON’s security, as they are implementation-level enhancements.

### What Changed?
The optimized version 4 of the ASCON algorithm introduces several key modifications compared to the original. It likely uses **bit-interleaving**, a technique that reorganizes the state’s bits to process multiple bits simultaneously on 32-bit processors. It also interleaves operations on the low and high halves of the state in the assembly code, allowing the processor to execute independent instructions concurrently. Additionally, it loads 16-bit round constants at once, reducing the number of load instructions compared to the original’s byte-by-byte approach.

### Why Were These Changes Made?
These modifications aim to boost performance on STM32 microcontrollers, which are commonly used in IoT devices with limited resources. By optimizing for the ARM Cortex-M architecture, the changes reduce pipeline stalls and maximize instruction-level parallelism, making the algorithm faster and more efficient for constrained environments.

### How Did It Influence Performance?
Testing shows that version 4 completes 20,000 iterations in 10.57 seconds, compared to 15.63 seconds for the original, suggesting a 32% speed improvement. This enhancement makes the algorithm more suitable for real-time IoT applications where quick cryptographic operations are critical.

# Optimization of ASCON for STM32 Microcontrollers: A Detailed Analysis

Imagine you’re building a tiny, battery-powered IoT device, like a smart sensor in a home security system, that needs to encrypt data quickly and securely without draining its limited resources. This is where ASCON, a lightweight cryptographic algorithm, shines, and where my research comes in. I’ve taken ASCON’s original implementation and optimized it specifically for STM32 microcontrollers, which are popular in IoT applications due to their efficiency and low power consumption. In this section, I’ll walk you through the changes I made, why I made them, how they impacted performance, and what this means for secure IoT systems. My goal is to make this clear and engaging, so whether you’re a fellow researcher, a professor, or an engineer, you’ll see why these optimizations matter.

## Background on ASCON

ASCON is a family of authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) and hashing algorithms, selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in February 2023 as the primary standard for lightweight cryptography ([NIST Lightweight Cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography)). Designed for resource-constrained devices, ASCON operates on a 320-bit state, organized into five 64-bit words, and uses a sponge-based permutation with bitwise operations (AND, NOT, XOR) and rotations. Its efficiency across platforms, from 8-bit to 64-bit processors, makes it ideal for IoT devices like those powered by STM32 microcontrollers, which are based on ARM Cortex-M cores.

The focus of this study is ASCON-AEAD128, a variant with a 128-bit key, 128-bit nonce, and 128-bit authentication tag, optimized for a 128-bit rate and 192-bit capacity. My research compares two implementations: the original `opt32_lowsize` (version 1), a 32-bit size-optimized pure C implementation, and an optimized `bi32_armv7m_small` (version 4), a 32-bit bit-interleaved implementation using C and inline assembly, tailored for ARMv7-M architectures like the STM32F407.

## Experimental Setup

To evaluate the performance of these implementations, I conducted experiments on an STM32F407 Discovery Board, a common platform for IoT development. The test involved running the `crypto_aead_encrypt` function 20,000 times, encrypting a 16-byte plaintext with a 16-byte key, nonce, and associated data. The test code, shown below, uses the HAL library to measure execution time via the `HAL_GetTick` function, ensuring accurate timing on the microcontroller.

```c
int ascon_main() {
  unsigned char n[32] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31};
  unsigned char k[32] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31};
  unsigned char a[32] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31};
  unsigned char m[32] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31};
  unsigned char c[32], h[32], t[32];
  unsigned long long alen = 16, mlen = 16, clen;
  int result = 0;

  uint32_t total_time = 0;
  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_13, 0); // LED ON
  HAL_Delay(5000); // Wait 5 seconds
  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_13, 1); // LED OFF
  uint32_t start_time = HAL_GetTick();
  for (int i = 0; i < 20000; i++) {
    result |= crypto_aead_encrypt(c, &clen, m, mlen, a, alen, NULL, n, k);
  }
  uint32_t end_time = HAL_GetTick();
  uint32_t elapsed = end_time - start_time;
  total_time += elapsed;

  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_13, 0); // LED ON
  HAL_Delay(5000 + result); // Wait 5 seconds
  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_13, 1); // LED OFF

  return result;
}
```

The results, summarized in Table 1, show the execution times for various ASCON implementations, with the optimized version achieving significant improvements.

**Table 1: Performance Results for ASCON Implementations**

| Implementation | Description | Time (seconds) | Speedup vs. Original [1] |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Original [1] | opt32_lowsize: 32-bit size-optimized (pure C) | 15.63 | - |
| Original [2] | opt32: 32-bit speed-optimized (pure C) | 13.31 | 14.8% |
| Original [3] | armv7m_small: 32-bit speed-optimized ARMv7-M (C + inline ASM) | 10.83 | 30.7% |
| Original [4] | bi32_armv7m_small: 32-bit bit-interleaved ARMv7-M (C + inline ASM) | 10.57 | 32.4% |
| Optimized | Further optimized bi32_armv7m_small | 9.44 | 39.6% |

## What Changed?

The optimized version, derived from the `bi32_armv7m_small` implementation (version 4), introduces several key modifications to the `ROUND_LOOP` function, which is critical to ASCON’s permutation phase. Let’s break down the changes:

1. **Efficient Constant Loading**
   - **Original:** Loads round constants one byte at a time using the `ldrb` instruction, requiring two loads per round to handle low and high halves.
   - **Optimized:** Loads a 16-bit constant in a single `ldrh` instruction, extracting high and low bytes using `ubfx` and `and` instructions. This reduces memory access overhead.

2. **Interleaved Low- and High-Half Operations**
   - **Original:** Processes the low half of the state completely before the high half, leading to sequential execution.
   - **Optimized:** Interleaves operations on low and high halves, performing similar computations concurrently. For example, XOR operations on `x0_l` and `x0_h` are executed back-to-back, reducing data dependency delays.

3. **Bit-Interleaving (Inherited from Version 4)**
   - The optimized version builds on version 4’s bit-interleaved state representation, where bits are reorganized to enable parallel processing of multiple S-box operations using 32-bit instructions. While not a change from version 4, it’s a foundational optimization compared to earlier versions like [1].

4. **Instruction Optimization**
   - The optimized version uses ARM-specific instructions like `ubfx` for efficient bit manipulation, aligning with the Cortex-M4’s capabilities.

These changes are evident in the `ROUND_LOOP` function, shown below for both versions:

**Original ROUND_LOOP (Version 1):**

```c
forceinline void ROUND_LOOP(ascon_state_t* s, const uint8_t* C, const uint8_t* E) {
  uint32_t tmp0, tmp1;
  __asm__ __volatile__(
      "rbegin_%=:;\n\t"
      "ldrb %[tmp1], [%[C]], #1\n\t"
      // Low-half operations
      "eor %[x0_l], %[x0_l], %[x4_l]\n\t"
      // ... other low-half operations ...
      "ldrb %[tmp1], [%[C]], #1\n\t"
      // High-half operations
      "eor %[x0_h], %[x0_h], %[x4_h]\n\t"
      // ... other high-half operations ...
      // Linear layer rotations
      "eor %[tmp0], %[x0_l], %[x0_h], ror #4\n\t"
      // ... other rotations ...
      "cmp %[C], %[E]\n\t"
      "bne rbegin_%=\n\t"
      : [x0_l] "+r"(s->w[0][0]), [x0_h] "+r"(s->w[0][1]), /* ... other registers ... */
      : /* inputs */
      : "cc");
}
```

**Optimized ROUND_LOOP (Version 4):**

```c
forceinline void ROUND_LOOP(ascon_state_t* s, const uint8_t* C, const uint8_t* E) {
  uint32_t tmp0, tmp1;
  __asm__ __volatile__(
      "rbegin_%=:\n\t"
      /* Load 16-bit constant */
      "ldrh %[tmp1], [%[C]], #2\n\t"
      "ubfx %[tmp0], %[tmp1], #8, #8\n\t"
      "and %[tmp1], %[tmp1], #0xFF\n\t"
      /* Interleaved low and high half operations */
      "eor %[x0_l], %[x0_l], %[x4_l]\n\t"
      "eor %[x0_h], %[x0_h], %[x4_h]\n\t"
      "eor %[x2_l], %[x2_l], %[x1_l]\n\t"
      "eor %[x2_l], %[x2_l], %[tmp1]\n\t"
      "eor %[x2_h], %[x2_h], %[x1_h]\n\t"
      "eor %[x2_h], %[x2_h], %[tmp0]\n\t"
      // ... other interleaved operations ...
      /* Linear layer rotations */
      "eor %[tmp0], %[x0_l], %[x0_h], ror #4\n\t"
      // ... other rotations ...
      "cmp %[C], %[E]\n\t"
      "bne rbegin_%=\n\t"
      : [x0_l] "+r"(s->w[0][0]), [x0_h] "+r"(s->w[0][1]), /* ... other registers ... */
      : /* inputs */
      : "cc");
}
```

## Why Were These Changes Made?

The optimizations target the STM32F407’s ARM Cortex-M4 core, which features a 3-stage pipeline and supports efficient bit-manipulation instructions. The rationale includes:

1. **Reducing Memory Access Latency**
   - Loading 16-bit constants in one instruction minimizes memory access cycles, as `ldrh` is faster than two `ldrb` instructions. This is critical since memory accesses can bottleneck performance on microcontrollers.

2. **Maximizing Pipeline Efficiency**
   - Interleaving low- and high-half operations reduces pipeline stalls by allowing the processor to execute independent instructions concurrently. The Cortex-M4’s pipeline benefits from such scheduling, as it can process multiple instructions in parallel if data dependencies are minimized.

3. **Leveraging Bit-Interleaving**
   - Bit-interleaving, inherited from version 4, reorganizes the state to process multiple S-box operations simultaneously, exploiting the 32-bit word size of the Cortex-M4. This reduces the number of instructions needed for the substitution layer.

4. **Utilizing Architecture-Specific Instructions**
   - Instructions like `ubfx` enable efficient bit extraction, aligning with the Cortex-M4’s DSP extensions, which are optimized for such operations.

These changes align with the needs of IoT applications, where fast cryptographic operations are essential for real-time data processing, such as in smart sensors or wearable devices.

## How Did These Changes Influence Performance?

The experimental results demonstrate a clear performance improvement:

- **Original Version [1] (opt32_lowsize):** 15.63 seconds
- **Original Version [4] (bi32_armv7m_small):** 10.57 seconds
- **Optimized Version:** 9.44 seconds

The optimized version is 39.6% faster than version [1] and 11.11% faster than version [4]. Progressive experiments further refined the performance:

- **Experiment 1:** 10.44 seconds (1.98% faster than version [4])
- **Experiment 2:** 9.56 seconds (9.28% faster than version [4])
- **Experiment 3:** 9.44 seconds (11.11% faster than version [4])

The 11.11% improvement from version [4] to the optimized version stems from the combined effect of reduced memory accesses and improved instruction scheduling. The 39.6% speedup over version [1] highlights the cumulative impact of bit-interleaving (introduced in version [4]) and the additional optimizations.

**Note on Reported Speedup Discrepancy:** The user’s claim of a 9.11% speedup from version [1] to version [4] appears inconsistent, as `(15.63 - 10.57) / 15.63 ≈ 0.324` yields a 32.4% improvement. Similarly, the 3.81% speedup from version [3] to [4] seems off, as `(10.83 - 10.57) / 10.83 ≈ 0.024` suggests a 2.4% improvement. For your thesis, verify these calculations or clarify the methodology to ensure accuracy.

## Additional Insights for Your Thesis

To make your thesis compelling, consider these questions and insights that deepen the analysis and connect to broader themes in lightweight cryptography and IoT security.

### How Does Bit-Interleaving Enhance Performance?

Bit-interleaving reorganizes the state’s bits so that multiple S-box operations, which are 5-bit transformations in ASCON, can be computed in parallel using 32-bit instructions. This is particularly effective on 32-bit processors like the Cortex-M4, where word-level operations are faster than bit-level manipulations. For example, a single XOR on a 32-bit word can process 32 bits simultaneously, reducing the instruction count for the substitution layer. This technique, detailed in the ASCON specification ([ASCON v1.2](https://ascon.isec.tugraz.at/files/asconv12-nist.pdf)), is a cornerstone of version [4] and the optimized version, making ASCON more efficient for IoT devices.

### What Role Does Inline Assembly Play?

Inline assembly allows precise control over instruction selection and scheduling, critical for performance-critical code like ASCON’s permutation. By writing assembly directly, I could interleave operations and use instructions like `ubfx`, which are optimized for the Cortex-M4. However, this comes at the cost of increased development complexity and reduced portability, as the code is tailored to ARMv7-M and later architectures.

### What Are the Trade-Offs?

Optimizations introduce trade-offs that are worth exploring in your thesis:

- **Code Complexity:** Inline assembly and bit-interleaving make the code harder to read and maintain, requiring expertise in ARM assembly.
- **Code Size:** While version [4] is labeled “small,” bit-interleaving may increase code size slightly. The ASCON C implementation repository ([ASCON C](https://github.com/ascon/ascon-c)) reports `bi32_armv7m_small` at 1090 bytes for ASCON-AEAD128, compared to 1162 bytes for `armv6m_lowsize`, suggesting a modest size trade-off.
- **Portability:** The optimized version is less portable, as it relies on ARM-specific instructions, unlike the pure C version [1].

### Are There Security Implications?

The optimizations are implementation-level changes and do not alter ASCON’s cryptographic properties. ASCON’s design includes natural resistance to side-channel attacks due to its low-degree S-box, and bit-interleaving does not introduce new vulnerabilities if implemented correctly ([Journal of Cryptology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00145-021-09398-7)). However, you should emphasize the need to verify the assembly code to prevent errors that could lead to side-channel leaks, such as timing attacks.

### Can These Techniques Apply Elsewhere?

The optimization strategies are broadly applicable:

- **Bit-Interleaving:** Useful for other lightweight ciphers like PRESENT or SIMON, enabling bitsliced implementations on 32-bit platforms ([Bit Twiddling](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html)).
- **Instruction Scheduling:** Interleaving operations to reduce pipeline stalls can optimize any algorithm with parallelizable computations.
- **Efficient Data Loading:** Loading larger data chunks benefits algorithms with frequent constant accesses, such as AES or ChaCha.

### What About Power Consumption?

While my experiments focused on execution time, power consumption is critical for IoT devices. Faster execution could reduce energy use by allowing the microcontroller to enter low-power modes sooner. Future work could measure power consumption using tools like the STM32 Power Shield, providing a more holistic view of optimization impacts.

### How Does This Fit into IoT Security?

ASCON’s selection as NIST’s lightweight cryptography standard underscores its importance for IoT security. My optimizations make ASCON faster on STM32 microcontrollers, enabling secure communication in applications like smart homes, wearables, and industrial sensors. This aligns with the growing demand for efficient, secure cryptography in resource-constrained environments.

## Future Research Directions

Your thesis can propose several avenues for further exploration:

- **Testing Across STM32 Variants:** Evaluate the optimized implementation on different STM32 series (e.g., STM32F0 with Cortex-M0 vs. STM32F4 with Cortex-M4) to assess performance variations.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Measure power consumption to quantify energy savings, critical for battery-powered IoT devices.
- **Comparison with Other Ciphers:** Benchmark ASCON against other NIST candidates, like Grain-128AEAD, to highlight its advantages on STM32 platforms.
- **Full Unrolling and DSP Extensions:** Explore loop unrolling or Cortex-M4 DSP instructions to further reduce execution time, as suggested in the optimization notes.

## Conclusion

By optimizing ASCON for STM32 microcontrollers, I achieved a 39.6% speedup over the original size-optimized implementation, making it more suitable for IoT applications. The changes—efficient constant loading, interleaved operations, and bit-interleaving—demonstrate how architecture-specific tuning can enhance cryptographic performance without compromising security. These findings offer practical guidelines for developers and highlight the importance of tailoring algorithms to hardware constraints, paving the way for faster, more secure IoT systems.
